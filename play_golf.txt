Golf 

In this assignment you will try to simulate a simple golf game. 
In the application, the user controls a golf player trying to get a golf ball to the cup/flag. 
The position of the flag should be randomized (to a maximum distance of 1000 meters away from the player).
Every swing you do with the club should take you closer to the flag. You simulate a swing (and the distance the ball moves) by:
 - selecting the angle of the ball’s trajectory, 
 - and the force you put behind the swing. 

The game ends when the ball reaches the flag position (or is inside the cup).  

Required Features: 
• The player should be able to launch the golf ball from its initial location, with a given angle (degrees from the ground up) and velocity (m/s at the start of the ball’s arc).
• The angle and velocity should determine how far the ball travels, reducing the distance between the starting location and the cup.
• Gravity should affect the ball while it travels, which should be used to determine the arc of the ball (use the distance formula supplied).
• The progress the player makes should be displayed between swings, showing the amount of swings the player has taken, as well as the distance to the cup.
• If the ball travels beyond the cup, the new distance should still be positive.
• When the ball has reached the goal (less than 1 meter from the flag), the game should end, displaying all swings taken, and how far the ball travelled each time.
• If too many swings have been taken (more than 10 swings), the game should end, with a failure message. 

Formulas:
• Angle In Radians: (Math.PI / 180) * angle          
• Distance: Math.Pow(velocity, 2) / GRAVITY * Math.Sin(2 * angleInRadians)  
• Gravity is equal to 9.8  
• Example: At 45 Degrees and 56 m/s, the ball should travel 320 meters
